Overall Process

The five essential tasks to complete the Course Project are as follows.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
These five steps will be accomplished via the process described below. Readers should also examine the codebook, and the full comments in the run_analysis.R file.

First, I downloaded the files and saved it into my working directory
Then I then merge the two raw data tables together.
Merged and extract only the measurements.
I read the set of activity labels from the activity_labels.txt file, then convert the labe codes to a factor that can be then transformed into a text string.
Finally, I bind the subject and activity to the filteredActivityData dataset.
